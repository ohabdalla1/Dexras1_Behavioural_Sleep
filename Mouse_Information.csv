Raw Data is found on the next sheet,,,,,,,,,,,,
Six PIR sensors were installed in one behavioural cabinet,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Six animals were tested at a time, for a total of six cohorts, with animal positions staggered according to genotype",,,,,,,,,,,,
The table below shows information on when baseline and post-deprivation recordings were taken,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Raw Data sheet column ""Time"" is inaccurate for two reasons:",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) The PIR device was built in Greenwich Mean Time, which is four hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) The PIR device is not connected to a computer, and has a lag of around 100 seconds every 2 weeks",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Column ""Ahead By"" below shows the time the device is ahead of real-time as of 9AM ""Acclimation to Cabinets"" column date",,,,,,,,,,,,
